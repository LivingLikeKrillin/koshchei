/**
 * The watcher (design §12): carries picasso export lines in as `symptom` signals and the host's JobResponses — picasso's
 * ResultExport (ADR 48), [ResultExportFile] — in as `evidence` signals. It carries, it does not judge — the only choices
 * it makes are the merge key ([correlate], pure) and which workflow a JobResponse goes to (the order its dispatch intent
 * named). At least once: the cursor moves only after Temporal took the signal; the core drops repeats by `eventId` /
 * (picasso `instanceId`, jobResponseId) (§6).
 *
 * A source is named by its directory's real path (resolved at every poll), so [exports] must be stable: another
 * spelling of the same directory that resolves elsewhere would be a new source and send its lines again.
 * Known limit: two export directories carrying the same runId collide on episode keys and eventIds (design §7.1 keys
 * carry no path).
 *
 * Known limit: a line whose signal always fails — Temporal refusing it for good (INVALID_ARGUMENT for an oversized
 * payload), or an instance whose `view()` query keeps failing — stops the pass at that line at every poll: the later
 * lines of every source, and all evidence, wait behind it. Nothing is skipped to get past it; its SIGNAL_FAILED row
 * names the line (source, runId, position, id) so a person can see which one it is (design §12).
