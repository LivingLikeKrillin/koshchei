/**
 * A person's confirmation of one item of the episode's `unknowns` (design §7.2, §9.1), in any phase but ESCALATED. In
 * ESCALATED the answer is `REFUSED_SUBJECT_NOT_UNKNOWN` by reuse (the transition table sends it past here): there is
 * no new Reply value for it.
 *
 * Three kinds of item are not confirmed here, and are refused as "not unknown" with the item kept:
 * - the candidate's own OUTCOME item (subject `candidateId`): the outcome check ([EpisodeEvent.ConfirmedOutcome]) decides
 *   the attempt and clears it together — clearing it here would leave UNKNOWN(OUTCOME) waiting with nothing unknown;
 * - an OUTCOME item on the current attempt's own `executionId` while the attempt awaits its outcome (AWAITING_EVIDENCE,
 *   UNKNOWN(OUTCOME)): that doubt is the outcome check's to settle, for the same reason. Once the attempt is over, the
 *   item is an ordinary one and a person may confirm it;
 * - a subject with no value at all: it names nothing, so it cannot name what was checked on site.
