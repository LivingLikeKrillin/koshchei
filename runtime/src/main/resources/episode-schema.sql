-- Episode audit and channel tables (design §8.5, §13). koshchei owns its database; applied by the owner account, never dropped.

-- and INSERT only (plan D-lite), and does not run this script: EpisodeStore.ensureSchema only checks the objects below
-- (keep its list in step); nothing in koshchei updates or deletes a row.
-- CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS never alters a table that is already there: a later column change must be its own
-- ALTER TABLE … ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS (and likewise for constraints), or existing databases keep the old shape.

-- CREATE … IF NOT EXISTS is not safe under concurrency: two workers starting together on a fresh database both pass the
-- check and one fails on pg_type's unique index. pgjdbc sends this whole script as one implicit transaction, so this
-- transaction-scoped lock serialises the script across workers; the key is arbitrary and used nowhere else.
