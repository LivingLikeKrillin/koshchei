/**
 * The agent-layer switch's broadcast (design §10.4, R5): `agentOff` to every open episode at once, so a waiting episode
 * learns now rather than at its next decision. Each goes to the workflow id's current run — every open episode is meant,
 * so no run is pinned. Sending twice is harmless: the core only records an `agentOff` for an episode already switched off.
 *
 * One attempt per listed episode per call. [Report.ended] is what the server answered NOT_FOUND for: the run ended
 * between the listing and the signal, or the id never existed. Any other failure goes to [Report.failed] with its root
 * cause, and the rest are still sent — run it again to retry them. Visibility is eventually
 * consistent: an episode that opens during the broadcast may be missed — switching the policy file off first (§10.4)
 * covers it, since every new episode reads the policy at its start.
