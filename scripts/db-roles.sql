-- The episode runtime's database role (design §13, R11; plan D-lite). Run by the OWNER account after episode-schema.sql:
--   psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -v rt_password='…' -U koshchei -d koshchei -f scripts/db-roles.sql
-- The runtime appends and reads; it never changes or removes a row (the tables are append-only by use, §13). The
-- password comes from the psql variable rt_password, never from this file. Safe to run again.
-- The -v value shows in shell history and process lists, and ALTER ROLE … PASSWORD is logged when log_statement is
-- ddl or all: pass a throwaway value and then set the real one with psql's \password koshchei_rt, which avoids both.
-- The names are unqualified: run it with the search_path the runtime uses (the schema episode-schema.sql was applied in).
-- Keep the table list in step with episode-schema.sql and EpisodeStore's SCHEMA_OBJECTS (EpisodeDbRolesTest checks).
