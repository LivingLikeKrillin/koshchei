 * 2. a response for another contract version, episode or attempt → DIAGNOSIS_FAILED (identity before anything else);
 * 3. a candidates version other than the one sent → CANDIDATES_VERSION_MISMATCH;
 * 4. NO_GROUNDS, UNCITED and OUT_OF_CANDIDATES escalate under their own names;
 * 5. RECOMMENDED without a candidate id (the reader rules this out) → DIAGNOSIS_FAILED, never a crash;
 * 6. RECOMMENDED `ESCALATE` → ESCALATE_RECOMMENDED;
 * 7. RECOMMENDED with no citation whose `verified` is the JSON boolean `true` → DIAGNOSIS_FAILED. koshchei re-checks
 *    contract §4 rule 3 itself; the string `"true"`, `1` or a missing field is unverified. This is not UNCITED: narrator's
 *    own UNCITED is a measured outcome, while a RECOMMENDED without a verified citation is narrator breaking its
 *    contract (design §5.2, "응답이 계약에 맞지 않음 → DIAGNOSIS_FAILED");
 * 8. RECOMMENDED of an id koshchei did not offer → OUT_OF_CANDIDATES (both judges agree). Ids match exactly: no trimming,
 *    no case folding;
 * 9. RECOMMENDED of an execution-class candidate while anything is unknown → UNKNOWN_BLOCKS_EXECUTION (a projection
 *    defect: projection never offers that combination);
